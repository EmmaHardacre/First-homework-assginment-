# First-homework-assginment-
This assingment was a cheet sheet for me to know how to use GitHib and how to bets code for my slef. I made it step by step for adding the README.md file and then said repeat for the index.html file. 
I chose the colors light gray for the back and black for the text beucase they are easy to see and they dont create a bright light when you are working on your page or looking at it so it doesn't hurt you eyes as much.
